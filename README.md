###A rails app for planning trips

You can currently add, edit, and delete the following:
* Trips
  * Name
  * Start Date
  * End Date

* Activities
  * Date
  * Name
  * Description
  * Location

#### Outstanding things to add:
- [ ] Reroute page upon sign up to to go trips page instead of landing page
- [ ] Edit user profile
- [ ] Add user name to top right header upon login
- [ ] Geocoding for location entries with map view
- [ ] Add collaborators on a trip
- [ ] Limit the ability to add an activity time based on trip time parameters
- [ ] Add confirm popups to edit/delete actions
- [ ] Add datepicker

This is my first rails project. If you have any feedback, please let me know!
